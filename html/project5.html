      <hr>
      <span>The global climate crisis is deeply linked to water, causing greater variability in the water cycle, reduced availability, and increased CO2 emissions from inadequate water and sanitation systems.<br><br></span>
        <span>>Addressing these issues requires urgent improvements in infrastructure, along with stronger policies, better project preparation, sustainable financing, and affordability measures.<br><br></span>
        <span>To meet these needs, the Facility includes two core components: one focused on public-private partnership structuring and another offering concessional co-investment for eligible climate-resilient projects.<br><br></span>
        <span>GCF funding will provide technical assistance for project preparation, capacity building, and ensuring climate integration in infrastructure design. With a USD 250 million loan commitment, the GCF will help close the funding gap for projects with higher initial costs but significant long-term climate and development benefits.<br><br></span>
