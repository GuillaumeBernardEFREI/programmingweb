      <hr>
      <span>West Kalimantan Province in Indonesia is increasingly exposed to severe climate-related threats, including deforestation, forest degradation, rising temperatures, flooding, and drought. 
        These hazards pose a particular risk to the provinceâ€™s peatland ecosystems, which are significant carbon sinks but highly susceptible to fire and degradation. Local communities, who depend heavily on natural resources, often lack the resilience and capacity to manage forests and agriculture sustainably.<br><br></span>
This project seeks to strengthen community resilience by promoting sustainable forest management and climate-adaptive agricultural practices across five key regencies: Kapuas Hulu, Ketapang, Kubu Raya, Sanggau, and Sintang.<br><br></span>
It will implement a range of institutional, technical, and financial strategies aimed at improving land use governance, increasing community involvement, and generating sustainable economic opportunities.<br><br></span>
