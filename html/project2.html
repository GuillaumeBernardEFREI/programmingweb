      <span>The Amazon Basin is highly vulnerable to climate change, facing more frequent droughts, rising temperatures, and increased flooding, which threaten water security, agriculture, ecosystems, and human health.<br><br></span>
        <span>These impacts worsen existing socio-economic challenges, including poverty and inequality, while also placing the region's vital carbon-storing forests and biodiversity at risk. This programme aims to strengthen climate resilience and water security through an integrated water resource management (IWRM) approach focused on vulnerable populations, especially Indigenous communities.<br><br></span>
        <span>Key adaptation strategies include improving hydroclimatic data systems, early warning mechanisms, and climate-resilient water and sanitation infrastructure. The initiative also supports knowledge sharing, investment in sustainable technologies, inclusive planning, and regional collaboration to address both immediate and long-term climate challenges.<br><br></span>
