      <hr>
      <span>Iraq is facing severe climate hazards, including rising temperatures, prolonged droughts, and decreasing water flows from the Euphrates and Tigris rivers, which are worsened by poor water management and high soil salinity.<br><br></span>
        <span>These challenges have significantly reduced agricultural productivity, especially in Najaf, Karbala, and Muthanna, where farming communities rely heavily on irrigation and have limited capacity to adapt.<br><br></span>
        <span>This project seeks to build climate resilience among vulnerable agricultural households by improving water efficiency through modern irrigation systems, strengthening Water User Associations, promoting climate-resilient farming, and advancing renewable energy solutions like solar-powered irrigation.<br><br></span>
        <span>Long-term reforms will focus on sustainable water and energy policies, better irrigation technologies, and the integration of renewable energy into agriculture. The project also emphasizes gender equity, empowering women to take leading roles in building resilient and inclusive rural communities.<br><br></span>
