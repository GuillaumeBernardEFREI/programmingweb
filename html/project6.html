      <hr>
      <span>Kenya is highly vulnerable to climate change, with agriculture key pillar of its economy facing rising temperatures, more intense droughts, and heavier rainfall causing floods in the Lake Victoria Region.<br><br></span>
        <span>This region, known as the Lake Region Economic Bloc (LREB), includes 14 counties that serve as a major agricultural hub.<br><br></span>
        <span>Smallholder farmers in the area have limited adaptive capacity, often farming marginal lands without access to resources or risk mitigation tools, leading to low productivity, land degradation, and increased emissions from deforestation. The project aims to develop climate-resilient, low-carbon, and financially sustainable agricultural value chains by promoting technology transfer, asset delivery, and knowledge sharing through empowered agri-food cooperatives.<br><br></span>
        <span>Building on previous GCF-supported efforts, it will enhance local government support, promote sustainable land management, strengthen farmer resilience, and improve access to markets.<br><br></span>
